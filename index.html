        <h2>My Tech Goals</h2>
        <p>Starting my frontend internship at HNG for six weeks is a major step forward in my tech journey! Here's my personalized roadmap for the next two years. </p>
        <b>1. Master the Basics(First 3 Weeks):</b> I'll dive deep into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Understanding not just how they work, but why they work that way will be key. Using the tasks given at HNG to rapidly hone my skills and coding speed. <br/>
               - <b>By Week 6:</b> I aim to build a personal project that excites me. Whether it's a blog, a portfolio site, or a small interactive app, it will reflect my creativity and learning. <br/>
            
        <b>2. Learn a Frontend Framework (Weeks 7-12:)</b> <br/>
                I'll choose a framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular. Preferably React as that is what we will be using for HNG. Learn and refine my sklils on it and build simple projects.<br/>
                 - <b>Weeks 13-18:</b> I want to create a more complex project, maybe a dynamic web application that showcases my skills. Sharing it with peers at HNG will be a great way to get feedback and improve.</br>
            
            <b>3. Real-World Projects (Months 3-12) :</b> <br/>
               Gain more experience working with real-world projects as i did during HNG internship either via bootcamps, more complex internships or personal freelance gigs, each project will teach me valuable lessons and boost my confidence. </br>
            
            <b>4. Soft Skills and Networking</b> </br> 
                Throughout I'll focus on clear communication and effective teamwork. Participating in meetings, sharing ideas, and listening to feedback will help me grow professionally.</br>
                I'll also attend HNG meetups and seek mentorship and connected with experienced tech colleagues. </br>
            
            <b>5. Career Growth(Year 2):</b> <br/>
               -By this time, I aim to have a strong portfolio showcasing at least three significant projects. These projects will demonstrate my growth and passion for frontend development. </br>
               - <b>Professional Advancement:</b> Seeking feedback regularly and aiming for a promotion or new opportunities within HNG or elsewhere will be my goal by the end of two years.</br>
            
            <b>6. Personal Development</b> <br/>
               - <b>Time Management:</b> Balancing internship tasks with personal projects and self-care  and other soft skills will be crucial. 
            
            This personalized plan will guide me through challenges and achievements during my frontend internship at HNG and beyond.</p>
